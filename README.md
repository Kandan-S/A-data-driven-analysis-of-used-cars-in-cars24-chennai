# 🚗 A Data-Driven Analysis of Used Cars

This project aims to explore and analyze the pricing patterns and market segmentation of used cars in India, using real-world data scraped from the Cars24 Chennai website. By applying data analytics techniques and tools such as Power Automate Desktop, Python, Excel, and Power BI, the study offers valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and dealers in the used car market.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Title:** A Data-Driven Analysis of Used Cars  
- **Author:** Kandan S  
- **Institution:** Pondicherry University (MBA - Data Analytics)  
- **Supervisor:** Dr. J. Rama Krishna Naik, Professor, Dept. of Management Studies

## 🧠 Objective

- Analyze average prices of used cars across different brands  
- Identify price influencers like fuel type, year, transmission, and ownership  
- Visualize findings for better understanding and strategic decision-making  
- Demonstrate practical use of data analytics tools in a real-world scenario

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power Automate Desktop:** For web scraping over 500 car listings from [Cars24 Chennai](https://www.cars24.com/buy-used-cars-chennai/)  
- **Microsoft Excel:** Data cleaning, formatting, and basic EDA  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn):** In-depth analysis, data wrangling, correlation study, and model building  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Transmission Impact:** Automatic cars have significantly higher average prices than manual ones  
- **Fuel Type Dominance:** Petrol cars dominate the market; electric and CNG vehicles remain niche  
- **Top Brands:** Tata, Renault, and Maruti Suzuki top resale volumes in Chennai  
- **Market Segmentation:** Clear split among premium (BMW, Mercedes), mid-range (Hyundai, MG), and budget (Maruti, Tata) brands  
- **Predictive Modeling:** A linear regression model was used to estimate car prices based on selected features

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Automated extraction using Power Automate Desktop  
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming string/numeric data, encoding categorical features  
3. **EDA:** Brand-wise, fuel-wise, type-wise, and location-wise analyses  
4. **Modeling:** Linear regression to predict price from key attributes  
5. **Visualization:** Graphs and dashboards built using Python and Power BI

## 📍 Notable Visualizations

- Brand-wise average price distribution  
- Transmission type vs average price  
- Fuel-type spread across brands  
- Location-wise car availability in Chennai  
- Correlation heatmap to identify key influencers on price

## 💡 Suggestions & Applications

- **For Buyers:** Choose first-owner, low-mileage, petrol or diesel vehicles for better value  
- **For Sellers:** Use analytics to determine optimal pricing strategies  
- **For Platforms like Cars24:** Implement predictive pricing tools and improve transparency  
- **For Researchers:** Expand to pan-India datasets or include service history for advanced modeling.
